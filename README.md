# Genre-Classification
Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), genre classification involves analyzing textual content to categorize it into specific genres. This process employs advanced linguistic algorithms to extract features like word frequencies, syntactic structures, and semantic meanings. By training machine learning models on labeled datasets,such as XGB and Logistic Regression getting accuracy of around 59.7% in XGB as the highest from it, the system learns to distinguish between genres based on these linguistic patterns. The document is then represented as a numerical feature vector, allowing the model to predict its genre. NLP in genre classification enhances automated content organization, recommendation systems, and information retrieval, facilitating efficient management and personalized access to diverse textual data.
